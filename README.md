# Travelblog
This is a custom wordpress theme for travel blogger with all you need, including posts by countries and tags, as well as posts about tips and tricks to survive. 
On the front page you can select your featured posts.
In each of the post, a navigation sidebar is fixed for shortcuts to the useful information during the trip.
